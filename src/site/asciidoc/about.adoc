== About

A library to support creating unit-tests and much more.
Compared to other, more behavior-oriented frameworks like
link:https://easymock.org/[EasyMock] or link:https://site.mockito.org/[Mockito], it focuses, as its name 
implies, on testing and generating Value-Objects of all sorts. Therefore it is no replacement of said frameworks but 
a supplement. Testing values-objects is about checking properties, constructors, factories, builder,... and the 
dependent canonical object-methods. In addition, the library provides a feature rich generator system.
